## Your `tinyc.games` repository

Alice and bob are working together on `tinyc.games`.
They both forked the repository:
- Alice's fork: <https://github.com/alice/tinyc.games>.
- Bob's fork: <https://github.com/bob/tinyc.games>.

{% hint style="info" %}
Task1:
- Alice will create a branch named `feature/backgroundcolors` and make it possible to change the background colors by pressing `b`
- Bob will create a branch named `feature/pillarcolors` and make it possible to change the pillar colors by pressing `p`
So far, both of them will push their feature branch in their own fork.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Task2:
- Alice's should merge her `feature/backgroundcolors` into `main`
- Bob will issue a pull request from his `feature/pillarcolors` to Alice's `main` branch
- Alice and Bob will review the pull request, solve conflicts and merge into Alice's `main` branch
{% endhint %}

At the end, the `main` branch of Alice's fork should contain a version of the flappy game that supports both changing the background and the pillar colors.
