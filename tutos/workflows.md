Git does not enforce a specific way of working.
Developpers of a team must define a common way of managing branches, ... to minimize conflicts and standardize development.

Most well-known workflows:

- The [feature branch model](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow): Complexity and overhead in managing multiple long-lived branches.
Integration challenges during feature merges.
- The [gitflow model](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow):
- The [trunk-based development](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/continuous-integration/trunk-based-development). Should solve the [merge hell problem](https://connect2grp.medium.com/branching-strategies-for-the-development-teams-95cafd7806c4) in models with long-live feature branches.
